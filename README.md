## Project Overview

- **City Selection**: 🌇 Choose from a diverse range of cities to stroll through and discover their unique vibes. (My personal recommendation: Start with Budapest!)

## Inspiration

Stroll & Groove was born out of the desire to explore new places and experience past adventures during lockdown. As a student preparing for university finals, I found myself missing out on the opportunity to travel to unique destinations. This project became my way of bringing the world to me, helping me study at home while virtually exploring different cities. I wanted to create an interactive and immersive experience that would transport users to exciting destinations and provide a much-needed break from everyday routines.
